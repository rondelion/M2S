# Python code for the Match to Sample Task
Prerequisite: pygame

Place [png files](../dm2s/png) in the png directory directly under the directory in which you run the program.

USE:
    
    python3 M2S.py M2S.par 
    
where M2S.par ([sample](../dm2s/DM2S.par)) contains parameters:

    mainTaskRepeat, # of actual trial sessions
    observationRepeat, # of observation sessions
    
In Observation phase + Actual trial phase:
  - It shows a sample figure for a while
  - Pause
  - It show a pair of figures, one of which matches to the sample
  - Wait for arrow key response (Left or Right) [automatic in the observation phase]

A blue bar at the top of the screen indicates the observation phase.
